# Heart-Diseases-Analysis-Classification

Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project:
Project Idea:
Some statistics and vital signs, and then does the person have a narrowing of the coronary arteries or not?

The project includes a model for classifying whether the person has coronary artery stenosis and is therefore exposed to heart disease or is far from the disease
And there is a score

decribe columns in the dataset
age: The patients age in years

sex: The patients gender(1=male; 0=female)

cp: Chest pain type, *Value 1: typical angina *Value 2: atypical angina *Value 3: non-anginal pain *Value 4: asymptomatic

trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: Serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl? (1=true; 0=false)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results *Value 0: normal *Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) *Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Chest pain(angina) after exercise? (1=yes; 0=no)

thal: Not described *Value 3=normal *Value 6=treated defect *Value 7=reversible defect

num: Target *Value 0: less than 50% narrowing of coronary arteries(no heart disease) *Value 1,2,3,4: >50% narrowing. The value indicates the stage of heart disease
